        {
          "question": "Can it blend ice?",
          "answer": "Yes! The 6-blade system easily handles ice cubes. For best results, add liquid first, then ice, then other ingredients. Small/medium ice cubes work best."
        },
        {
          "question": "How many smoothies per charge?",
          "answer": "You'll get 15-20 full blends on a single charge, depending on ingredients. Frozen items use more power than fresh. The LED indicator shows battery level."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it loud?",
          "answer": "It's quieter than traditional blenders but not silent. About the volume of a hair dryer. Fine for office use - blend in the break room or kitchen area."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I clean it?",
          "answer": "Easy! Add warm water and a drop of dish soap, run the self-cleaning cycle. Or pop the cup in the dishwasher. The blade assembly rinses clean under running water."
        },
        {
          "question": "What can't it blend?",
          "answer": "Avoid very hard items like coffee beans, whole nuts, or large frozen chunks. It's designed for smoothies, shakes, and soft/frozen fruits - not a food processor replacement."
